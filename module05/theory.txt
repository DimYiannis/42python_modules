Polymorphism in Python is the idea that different objects can respond to the same method or operation in their own way. Same name, different behavior. Python is very good at this because it’s dynamically typed

How does method overriding enable the same processing interface to
handle completely different data types? What makes this approach
more powerful than separate processing functions?

-> Method overriding is better than separate functions 
because it enables polymorphism, reduces coupling,
and allows new behavior to be added without changing existing code

Coupling = how much changing one thing forces you to change something else

-High coupling → many dependencies → fragile code
-Low coupling → few dependencies → flexible code

Method overriding:

-Enables runtime selection of behavior
-Allows one interface to support many data types
-Decouples callers from implementations

This is more powerful than separate functions because it:

-Scales better
-Reduces coupling
-Eliminates type-based conditionals
-Follows solid OOP principles

-Protocol is structural typing (also called "duck typing"). It means: 
"If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck."

-Duck typing lets you rely on the presence of a method instead of inheriting from a specific class.

When duck typing is ideal

-Simple, behavior-based interfaces

-Plugins, callbacks, adapters

-Rapid development


Subtype polymorphism (also called inclusion polymorphism) means:

A subclass object can be used wherever a superclass object is expected, and its overridden methods will be called.

Core idea

A base type defines an interface

Subtypes (subclasses) provide different implementations

The program works with the base type, not the concrete subtype

No—subtype polymorphism relies on inheritance, while duck typing achieves polymorphism without inheritance by relying on method presence.

1. Method Overloading

Definition:
Method overloading means defining multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.

2. Method Overriding

Definition:
Method overriding means a child class provides its own implementation of a method defined in a parent class.
